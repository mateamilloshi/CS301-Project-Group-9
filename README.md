# CS301-Project-Group-9 
## Pricing Ground Inc.

<p>
We will be investigating how house prices increase or decrease depending on different factors. These factors can be the current house supply, demand and different characteristics of the house. With the current house pricing crisis it would be interesting to see what the catalyst factors that influence the price the most.  

We would need to read up on the many different aspects of both house pricing and practices for good linear regression execution. Kaggle also provides tutorials within the competition itself which then we can modify and improve for our purposes.

Using the data provided in the kaggle competition with the title of  “House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques” which has 80 data fields and over 1400 rows. That should be enough for our purposes.



We expect results in the form of a list of prices for the houses in the data. We would subsequently graph the data to better display it, and use t tests to evaluate the results. A t test is appropriate because the data in the two sets (consisting of the set that is produced as our result from the training set and the test set). Additionally, we could perform a regression test and correlational tests as needed to better understand the dimensions of the project.
